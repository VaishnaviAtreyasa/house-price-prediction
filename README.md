# House Price Predictor (v1.0)
A machine learning project built during my 3rd-semester break to master the fundamentals of Linear Regression and Data Science workflows.

# Overview
This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict property values based on square footage. It serves as a practical application of **Linear Algebra and Applications**, which I will be studying in Semester 4.

# Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core logic
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation (Matrices)
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine Learning (Ordinary Least Squares)
- **Git/GitHub**: Version Control

# Results
- **Model Type**: Linear Regression
- **Example Prediction**: A 2,800 SqFt house is valued at approximately **$560,000.00**.
